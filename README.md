Users (administrators, faculty, and students) will be able to view, add, update, and delete student records, track course enrolments, and monitor academic progress. The app will enhance operational efficienzreduce administrative workload, and improve data accessibility among students who, in normal circumstances, do not have access to online interaction with their instructors/professors, especially in African countries in the third-world category.
Scope
This project will provide features for student enrolment, course registration, and performance tracking. It will focus solely on basic data management for educational records, which will give the students a streamlined experience to access and send their assignments online even when the owner isn't present.

This can greatly help ensure that assignments are submitted, without power outages being used as an excuse by college-aged students.
